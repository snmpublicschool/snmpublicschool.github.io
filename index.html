               <h3>Message from Principal </h3>
               <p>Education is the flame that not only removes the darkness of ignorance but also imparts such rays that glorifies the person like a sun that enlightens the whole world.
Shri S.N. Memorial Public School has been serving the society since 2011. Our purpose is to motivate students for better learning. The school is at its best to inculcate in students the habit of punctuality and regularity and bring desirable changes in students through instruction, example and influence.

For the all round development of students we are in our best effort to improve their curricular as well as co-curricular performance. The school has imparted all the possible facilities to students to enable them get success in every field of life. Our qualified and experienced teachers guide the students to get excellence in every sphere.

I take this opportunity to convey my sincere thanks to the parents, guardians and well wishers whose co-operation and valuable feedback has always been helpful to us. I also thank the teaching, administrative and support staff for their unflinching efforts during the academic year. I am also thankful to Mr. Suresh Dobhal, Manager Shri S.N. Memorial Education Mission for his support in all our endeavours. His blessings guide us to perform better.

             <h3>Message from Manager</h3>
            <p>"If a doctor, lawyer or dentist had 40 people in his office at one time, all of who had different needs, and some of whom didn’t want to be there and were causing trouble, and the doctor, lawyer, or dentist, without assistance, had to trust them all with professional excellence for nine months, then he might have some conception of the class-room teacher’s job”.
It gives me an immense pleasure in conveying my deep appreciation to the staff and students who have been performing their onerous duties and fulfilling their responsibilities with a sense of commitment.

School is not merely a building, furniture and staff but it the students who completes the existence of school. Teachers are the most influential people in the lives of young children whatever teaching they give to their students they follow them. So I want to make an appeal to respectable fraternity of academic staff that never let down the honour shown to us by the society to lead the nation by making your students a honourable citizen of the country.

There is a voice inside of you that whispers all day long :

“I feel this is right for me, I know that this is wrong”. No teacher, preacher, parent, friend or wise man can decide what’s right for you – just listen to the voice that speaks inside.
<br>
Jai Hind<br>
Mr. Suresh Chandra<br>
(Manager)
